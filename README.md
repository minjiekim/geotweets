# Geo-tagged Tweets
In this lab, I am using the Twitter API to collect geo-tagged tweets in certain areas and analyzing them for keywords to create a word cloud. Due to the nature of the code, the East coast section slighty extends into where most people consider to be the Midwest.  Also, in the word cloud, you might find some innapropriate words.
## East Coast v. West Coast
I've decided to compare the geo-tagged tweets from the east versus the west coast.  This comparison makes sense because both coasts has many metropolitan areas as well as more suburbian and rural areas.  With this comparison, I'm hoping to see if the people of the west and east coast tweet about similar stuff or if there is a difference in the type of stuff that they tweet.

### Compare and Discuss
Looking at these two maps, we can see that in the West Coast, there are concentrations of areas where most of these tweets are from, but in the East Coast map, the tweets are more spread out location wise. These two maps represent different geospatial patterns on the map because there are of tweets from two different locations.

### Compare and Discuss
Looking at the word cloud for both coasts, they have similar contexts.  They all talk about politics, sports, and mention places.  The East Coast tweets seem to have more words related to politics, while the west coast has a lot of words associated with sports and social issues.  They represent different context because these tweets are from different people in two different areas of the US.
